## 1. Lab Workbook

Module-wise lab experiments and assignments, each with a problem statement,
objective, source code, output screenshots, and observations.

| Module | Topics | Assignments |
|---|---|---|
| **M1 — Selenium Automation** | WebDriver setup, locators, XPath/CSS selectors, navigation, alerts, frames/windows, mouse & keyboard actions, web tables, waits, screenshots, exception handling, JS execution | 6 |
| **M2 — Unit Test Frameworks** | `unittest`, PyTest, Page Object Model (POM) | 3 |
| **M3 — Python BDD & REST Automation** | Python HTTP libraries, API automation, HTTP response handling, BDD with Behave | 3 |
| **M4 — Robot Framework** | Setup and running options, keyword-driven and data-driven testing | 2 |

Each assignment folder is self-contained, with its own README, script(s), and
a `screenshots/` folder showing terminal/output proof of execution.

## 2. Capstone Project

A **Python API automation framework** built with `requests`, Behave (BDD),
JSON Schema validation, and Allure reporting, tested against
[jsonplaceholder.typicode.com](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) with an
authentication demo against [automationexercise.com/api](https://automationexercise.com/api_list).

Highlights:
- Reusable, DRY HTTP client layer (`api_client/`)
- Plain-English `Given/When/Then` scenarios (`features/`)
- Contract validation via JSON Schema (`schemas/`)
- Data-driven tests from JSON/YAML (`test_data/`)
- Allure reports with request/response bodies attached to each step
- Environment switching via a single config variable

See [`2_Capstone_Project/api-automation-framework/README.md`](2_Capstone_Project/api-automation-framework/README.md)
for full setup and run instructions, and `Project_Report/` for the written
project report.

## 3. Certificates
